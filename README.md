## ankan
Hi, I am Ankan, a part-time self-taught programmer and a full-time overthinker.

Dabbling in Java, Python, Golang(novice), Kotlin(mostly at work), Typescript(mostly at work), PostgreSQL, and various other languages. 
I am excited about Infrastructure-as-code, and would love to contribute as and when I come across. I have experience using the OG open-source tools - Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and RabbitMQ.

Currently dealing with software services to manage resources for various Google product areas.
Previously, I have worked on creating software services for network and security policy orchestration.

My concrete goals are to improve my current work, be better at competitive programming, and learn some algorithms in the process.

Further, I am currently getting deep into Distributed Systems, System Design(LLD & HLD), and Golang. I mostly prefer starting with MIT courses(gold mine).

Planning to get into open-source soon, mostly with Java, Python, and Kotlin.

Enough of the Programming Shit?<br>
Reading Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky, and strumming the Ukulele.

Always have music playing—love Hard Rock,Punk Rock, Grunge, Metal, Rabindra Sangeet, and some old Bollywood hits.
