## ankan
Hi, I am Ankan, a part-time self-taught programmer and a full-time overthinker.

Dabbling in Java, Python, Golang(novice), Kotlin(mostly at work), Typescript(mostly at work), PostgreSQL, and various other languages. 
I am excited about Infrastructure-as-code, and would love to contribute as and when I come across. I have experience using the OG open-source tools - Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, and RabbitMQ.

Previously, I have worked on creating software services for network and security policy orchestration.
Currently dealing with the management of resources for various Google Product Areas.

The concrete goals for me are to be better at what I do already, be consistent on [leetcode](https://leetcode.com/ankanchanda/) and cp-platforms(sometimes), and learn some algorithms in the process.

Further, I am currently getting deep into Distributed Systems, System Design(LLD & HLD), and Golang. I mostly prefer starting with MIT courses(gold mine).

Planning to get into open-source soon, mostly with Java, Python, and Kotlin.

Enough of the Programming Shit?<br>
Reading Crime and Punishment by Dostoevsky, and strumming the Ukulele.

Recently got carried away by the quote: "Who am I without melancholy, nostalgia, daydreaming, music, and empathy?"<be>

YouTube playlists I am most proud of: [Scarcely Alive?](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfsQjmvBnTRs_JafzdA2CrU-xLRDfM5M&si=OxS51uPO23VpHyow), [हिन्दी](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfsQjmvBnTQk6j3L4SAbo2C3eThSeK22&si=tFDNS-1xp8dXZaVF), [বাংলা](https://music.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhfsQjmvBnTTiwnFLxpsQpVaQVp4YsQHu&si=P34Vbnex1vUTSt-s)
